# FoursquareClone
I tried to make a clone of the Foursquare app. In this project, I used Firebase authentication pods to create new users on a cloud server and log in with them. I also used firebase storage to save images, locations and texts on the cloud server. Everyone can easily create a new user and log in with it. 

This project only simulated on iPhone 11 Pro MAX and screen layout only available for that device.
